# Breathe
an iOS app for Breathing exercises

This will be a simple app to listen to 2 minute audio files guiding users through various levels of breathing exercises. 

Users will have a choice of programs starting with an intro and progressing from there. 

Files in each program must be listened to in order the first time around. The first minute is an introduction/description of the exercise and the second minute is a walk-through. There are 5 exercises in each program. 

If anybody uses it we might add the ability to mark favourites, track progress, give feedback, perhaps even upload their own exercises.
